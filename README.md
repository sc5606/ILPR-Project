# Indian Liver Patient Records (ILPR)
### Patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India

## Context
Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.

## Content
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".

**Columns in the dataset:**

Age: of the patient
Gender: of the patient
Total_Bilirubin
Direct_Bilirubin
Alkaline_Phosphotase
Alamine_Aminotransferase
Aspartate_Aminotransferase
Total_Protiens
Albumin
Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio
Dataset: field used to split the data into two sets (patient with liver disease, or no disease)

## Inspiration
Use these patient records to determine which patients have liver disease and which ones do not.

## About this file
Based on chemical compounds(bilrubin,albumin,protiens,alkaline phosphatase) present in human body and tests like SGOT , SGPT the outcome mentioned whether person is patient ie needs to be diagnosed or not.
